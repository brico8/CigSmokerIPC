Cigarette smoker is a problem in Inter Process communication (IPC), according to Kirkpatrick (2019), this is a synchronization issues that involves three smokers and a agent. The agent is one who provides ingredients to the smokers at a table, each smoker has a infinite supply of one ingredient to make their cigarette while the agent places two random ingredients at the table at the time. The smoker who is missing ingredients picks up the ingredients, makes and smokes their cigar and signals the agent when they have finished smoking. The ingredients are paper, tobacco and matches. This process is important in IPC as it shows where multiple process might depend on a set of shared resources and how must it be managed. It is a synchronization issue that demonstrates how processes can depend on the same resources and how scheduling in the computer works with allotting these resources. I chose this because it is key problem in IPC and can help me to understand how to solve it and how real world experiences.
